# SimpleOS

**Nintendo DS** focused cfw for the [Anbernic RG DS](https://anbernic.com/).
It features a DS-style home menu that supports both screens, and a simple in-game menu.
Inspired by [Shauninman's](https://github.com/shauninman)
[Dedicated OS](https://github.com/dedicated-os/dedicated-zero40)
for the MagiXZero40. 

This is **not** a fully fledged OS built from the ground up. It lays upon Anbernic's Linux OS.
DraStic and Nintendo BIOS files are **not** distributed here; SimpleOS uses the
copies already present on official Anbernic Linux.


## Purpose

SimpleOS replaces the multi-system frontend with a DS-only shell:

1. **Fast start**
2. **DS library only** — `.nds` / `.dsi` / `.zip`. No other systems at runtime.
3. **DSi-like UI** 
4. **In-game menu**


## Installation

Latest package: [`releases/SimpleOS-RGDS-20260908.zip`](https://github.com/boorngos/SimpleOS/releases/tag/V1.0-SimpleOS)

1. Flash official Anbernic Linux on the TF card.
2. On a PC, open the user partition (the one with `Roms/`).
3. Extract the zip **into that directory** (merge `Roms/` if Windows asks).
4. Boot the RG DS
5. Go into **APPS → Install SimpleOS**.
6. Wait until the process is finished
7. The handheld reboots into SimpleOS.
8. If the top screen doesn't show up, click **start** → **reboot**
